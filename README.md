# 9103-TUT3-qzha6629_Audio-Individual-Assignment

# Project Description
This is an individual assignment for the IDEA9103 final project.  The owner of this repository is qzha6629. Our group selected Piet Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie as our artwork. I utilised audio as the primary trigger for animating the overall vivid and dynamicÂ work life and global surroundings. I aim to show viewer the society as assembly line with seek joy amidst sorrow through movements of rectangles and gradient color array.

# Interaction Instruction
Press the mouse button once.  The sounds and the movements commence simultaneously. The audio lyrics matches the movements. There are two pieces of music: the smooth one is to match the movement of small rectangles; the stronger lyric matches big rectangles. The audio tensity choose might also means the power of the authority.

# Animation of the Image and Its Distinctiveness


# Inspiration
This audio edition reflects my own unique imagination.  The rapid pace of global living and working conditions prompts me to see this unfinished masterwork as a significant collective workspace.  I envisioned the small rectangles on the thick lines as diligent individuals, while the large rectangles represent governors, such as governmental bodies and corporate executives, tasked with enhancing the overall environment through administration and regulation.

Nusra Latif Qureshi: Birds in Far Pavilions 

I started to search similar topic which matches my assuption. This artwork further inspires me to consider how many individuals in society face numerous constraints, such as oversight from superiors, politicians, and extensive data surveillance.  These constraints are commonplace throughout our lives.  Nevertheless, despite an outwardly joyful and orderly existence, individuals are constrained by numerous factors.
